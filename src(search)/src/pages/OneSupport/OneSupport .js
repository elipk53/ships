                  Most photos can be improved by cropping. Some need to have the
                  horizon leveled perhaps by checking vertical structures in the
                  background. Many can be improved by judicious use of a Sharpen
                  tool. The consequence of back lighting or a dull day can often
                  be remedied by tuning tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It may be necessary to resize your image to meet the site
                  standard of between 768 x 768 pixels and 4000 x 4000 pixels,
                  and the file size maximum is 4MB.

                <p>
                  Practice and experimentation will provide opportunities for
                  developing a variety of combinations of the manipulation
                  tools.

                  Remember that Shipspotting photos are not meant to be creative
                  works of art, they should capture a realistic looking scene
                  dominated by a ship.

                  Manipulation (sometimes described as Editing or Enhancement)
                  is a routine process for most photographers. It is a follow on
                  to judgments made while taking the shot; such as for focus,
                  shutter speed and framing the shot. Many photographers believe
                  that they can use their camera at one of the Auto settings
                  because of the power of manipulation software.

                  Picasa is used here as an example. The principles are similar
                  for all manipulation programmes.
